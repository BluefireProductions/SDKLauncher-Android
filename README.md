How to get source from github
-------------------------------
 git clone --recursive https://github.com/readium/SDKLauncher-Android.git


Debug C++ code on Android Studio 2
----------------------------------

Gradle experimental build plugin and Android Studio 2 are required to debug C++ code.
By default the project uses stable version of gradle plugin but you can switch easily to the experimental one by adding the following line to local.properties file:
````
readium.ndk_debug=true
````

This settings will switch the build system to the gradle experimental version and allow you to debug, add breakpoints on the C++ code.

You must be careful that if you switch from the stable to the experimental version, you have first to delete all intermediate build files in:
- Platform/Android/epub3/build
- Platform/Android/include
- Platform/Android/obj
- Platform/Android/libs

If you forget to delete these files, the application will crash because of bad version of shared and static libraries.
